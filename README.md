# Near-Weekly-Report

NEAR Protocol is a proof-of-stake public blockchain with smart contract capability that aims to act as a community-managed cloud computing platform. Â It provides a platform on which developers can build decentralized applications (dapps).

Each week, the NEAR Foundation publishes publish data to help the NEAR community understand the health of the ecosystem as part of their Transparency Report.

One of the main aspects to consider for these type of L1 blockchains is the competence. Users are constantly choosing for the best network to act and to use considering several aspects such as speed, success transactions, performance etc.

The intention of this report is to provide information about the current status of Near Protocol network activity by providing metrics such as: 
- New users
- Active users
- Executed transactions
- Generated fees
- Gas used
- New contracts
- Active contracts
